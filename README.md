# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project
This repository contains an analysis of an e-commerce database using SQL and Power BI. The database consists of several tables, including customer, order_items_dataset, order_payments, orders, and products. The data represents various aspects of an e-commerce business, such as customer information, order details, product information, and payment records.

# Database
The database is stored in SQL format and can be accessed using SQL Server or any compatible database management system. The CSV files provided for each table were imported into the database, ensuring that the data is structured and ready for analysis.
# Queries
Several SQL queries were performed on the database to extract meaningful insights and perform data analysis. The queries covered various aspects, such as calculating the average shipping cost and price per product category, checking for duplicate values, and retrieving data for visualization purposes.
